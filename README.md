# Video-Scene-Classification-Based-on-Python-and-Tensorflow
The aim of this project was to classify a single scene in a video and then attach/mix an appropriate sound to the video.


The project contains,
1- subprocess_learn_mod.py --> The main Python file that should be executed to see the results.
2- classify_image_mod.py --> Modified file from Tensorflow's models repository that gives a single string as an output that is read by the main program.
3- Test files such as the 458_video, Pistol.mp4.
4- Sounds to be attached.

Pre-Requisites for this program,
1- Python 3.5.2
2- OpenCV 3.0+
3- TensorFlow Models Repo.
4- ffmpeg
